Feedo-Android
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Feedo/Feedo-Android.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Feedo/Feedo-Android)

This as an Android-Client for Feedo-Instances. This was, for now, only tested on Android 4.3, but in theory, it should work starting at API-Level 9 (currently, we're going to merge to 8, String.isEmpty() is evil.)

You can find a more or less up-to-date apk at the releases. A nightly from travis is usually [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d7g9env8evoapux/FeedoNightly.apk).
